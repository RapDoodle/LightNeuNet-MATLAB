# LightNeuNet-MATLAB
LightNeuNet-MATLAB is a lightweight neural network framework built for academic use.

## Features
Currently, the toolbox supports the training of the following types of networks
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Deep Belief Network (DBN)
  - BernoulliRBMM
  - GaussianBernoulliRBM
- Genetic Algorithm
  - Artificial Neural Network (GASequentialModel)

## Usage
To use this library/toolbox, I recommend using the repository [LightNeuNet-MATLAB-Template](https://github.com/RapDoodle/LightNeuNet-MATLAB-Template) as a starting point. For more information, please visit https://github.com/RapDoodle/LightNeuNet-MATLAB-Template.
